# 🚢 PROJECT TITANIC

During this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) by applying various data analysis and visualization techniques:

🔍 Exploration: I explored the dataset to understand its structure, the types of variables present, and how they are distributed.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation: I cleaned and prepared the dataset by manipulating the data to make it more accessible and useful for analysis. This included handling missing values, converting data types, and generating new variables from existing ones.

📊 Data Analysis: I extracted useful and meaningful information from the dataset using various data analysis techniques.

📉 Data Visualization: I created charts and diagrams to help understand and communicate the patterns and relationships present in the data.

### 📋 Results
The results of the analysis can be found in the file Analisis_Titanic.ipynb.
