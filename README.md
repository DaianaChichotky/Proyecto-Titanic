# 🚢 PROJECT TITANIC

During this project, I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) by applying various data analysis and visualization techniques:

🔍 Exploration: I will explore the dataset to understand its structure, the types of variables present, and how they are distributed.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation: I will clean and prepare the dataset by manipulating the data to make it more accessible and useful for analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and generating new variables from existing ones.

📊 Data Analysis: I will extract useful and meaningful information from the dataset using various data analysis techniques.

📉 Data Visualization: I will create charts and diagrams to help understand and communicate the patterns and relationships present in the data.

### 📋 Results
The results of the analysis can be found in the file Analisis_Titanic.ipynb.
